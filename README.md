<H1> Polynomial & Monomial (Grade: 100)</h1>

This assignment is writing in C++ in OOP class as part of my B.Sc degree in Computer Science.

<h3>Information</h3>

* In this project we had to write a Polynomial & Monomial classes.

* The emphasis of the assignment was operators overloading. 

* We asked use  char * and not string .

<h4>Using operators overloading in Monomials:</h4>

* =
* ==
* +,-,*
* - unary
* !=
* () will return the result of the polynomial / monomial .
* +=,-=,*=

<h4>Using operators overloading in Polynomial:</h4>
